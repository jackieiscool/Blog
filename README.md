#Rspec Homework

On your last rspec homework I gave you code and you had to write specs.  
Now we are going to do this TDD style. Here is some specs, go write some code.  

###Where to start...

1. Clone this github repo. you will add code into it.  
2. You are creating a blog.  
3. It has...  
	- Users
	- Posts
	- Comments
4. Think about relationships...  
	- users have posts and comments that they've authored
	- posts have comments
	- comments belong to an author and a post
5. All the models you need are here (though feel free to add extra features if you are ambitious :)  
6. Remember to read the describes to figure out what methods you need.  
7. Your main goal is to **make the tests pass**. If all your tests pass the assignment is complete.
